Ergo is a modern IRC server written in Go. Its core design principles are:

* Being simple to set up and use
* Combining the features of an ircd, a services framework, and a bouncer:
  * Integrated account management
  * History storage
  * Bouncer functionality
* Bleeding-edge IRCv3 support
* High customizability via a rehashable (i.e., reloadable at runtime) YAML config

=== Installing ===

Copy the example config file to ircd.yaml with a command like:

    $ cp default.yaml ircd.yaml

Modify the config file as needed (the recommendations at the top may be helpful).

To generate passwords for opers and connect passwords, you can use this command:

    $ ergo genpasswd

If you need to generate self-signed TLS certificates, use this command:

    $ ergo mkcerts

You are now ready to start Ergo!

    $ ergo run

For further instructions, consult the manual. A copy of the manual should be
